title: About me
---

## Hi.

I am a software developer.  I have been developed commercial software for living but always felt something important missed, then came to know that I like to write programs useful for people while enjoying some joys from functional programming. In recent years, I used Clojure in my development and got understanding of it much more. I am expanding my interest to Guile(an implementation of Scheme) and Guix package manager.
